## About

OmnimoTask 

## Getting Started

To get your Laravel project up and running,

### Prerequisites

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads) (version 8.1 or higher)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (includes npm)
- A web browser

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, open your terminal and run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/CucamberMaster/OmnimoTask.git

Then navigate into the project directory:
cd OmnimoTask

Resolve any merge conflicts. 
If you see conflicts in files (like README.md), open those files in a text editor, resolve the conflicts, and save your changes.

Stage and commit the resolved files:

git add .


git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"


Install PHP dependencies using Composer (for using this application, you need XAMPP and MariaDB):


composer install

Install front-end dependencies using npm:

npm install

Compile your assets (if applicable, for example, if you're using Laravel Mix):


npm run dev

Start the Laravel development server:


php artisan serve

By default, this will serve your application at http://localhost:8000.

Run the database migrations (if your project uses a database):


php artisan migrate

Seed the database with initial data (if you have seeders set up):


php artisan db:seed

Access your application by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Login or Register

If you want to log in, use the following credentials:

Email: test@gmail.com

Password: test

Additional Notes
Ensure your .env file is correctly configured, especially the database settings, before running migrations.
If you face any issues during composer install or npm install, check for any error messages in the console.
If you are unsure about merge conflicts, consider backing up your local changes before proceeding.
